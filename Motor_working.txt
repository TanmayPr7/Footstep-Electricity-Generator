# An electric motor is electrical device which converts electrical energy
into mechanical energy,  motors operate through the interaction between 
the motor's magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to 
generate force in the form of motion of the motor's shaft.

# Use of motor in this project:
As, we known motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy when
electricity passes through terminals of motor to motor through external 
electrical supply, And it also acts vise-versa, when someone turns the shaft
of motor through hand or any external source, it will produce electricity 
at its terminal and that can be stored and used in many ways.
