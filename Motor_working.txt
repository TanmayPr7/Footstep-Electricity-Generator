# An electric motor is electrical device which converts electrical energy
into mechanical energy,  motors operate through the interaction between 
the motor's magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to 
generate force in the form of motion of the motor's shaft.

# Use of motor in this project:
As, we known motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy when
electricity passes through terminals of motor to motor through external 
electrical supply, And it also acts vise-versa, when someone turns the shaft
of motor through hand or any external source, it will produce electricity 
at its terminal and that can be stored and used in many ways. In this way 
motor acts as generator to produce electricity.

# In this project we are going to use 12v DC Geared Motor(1000 RPM) as 
generator, to produce of electricity, store it and later use it.
