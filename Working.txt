# Motive: The motive of this project is to generate electricity with help of 
Dc Motor, in an eco-friendly way and to generate eco_friendly energy.

# This is a basic physics project which uses, DC Motor, LED's, Springs, etc,
It basically works, as electricity generator through footsteps of humans.
When a human climp up this staircase fitted with this type of Tiles, the 
floor moves downward as, springs holding the floor shrinks due humans weight
which automatically makes the straight spur gear connected to circular spur gear
which later connected to DC motor, moves down which makes the connected circular
spur gear to rotate, which rotates the shaft of Dc Motor.
